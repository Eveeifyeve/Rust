# Getting Started

Get Started by creating a new discord application and adding the bot to a server.

1. Add The Following Credentials to your `.env` by making a file and using the [exsample](.env.example).
2. It's very important that you don't reveal your token & clientSecret to anyone, as it can be abused.
3. Run the discord bot with `cargo run` if getting errors, try going through steps 1 and 2 again.
4. Now you have a discord bot! You can manage it by going to the portal on localhost:3000.
